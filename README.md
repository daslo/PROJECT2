# Temperature
Project on STM32F103C8 ("Blue Pill").

It's an exercise in programming STM32 basing as much as possible on uC's datasheet and Reference Manual. The code works on uC's registers (without libraries such as StdPeriph or HAL).

Reading temperature from DHT11 digital temperature sensor, LM35 analog temperature sensor, NTC temperature sensor and STM32's internal temperature sensor.

The data is displayed on TM1638 based board and sent over USART.
